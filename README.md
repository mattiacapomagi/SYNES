# BRICKLAB

BRICKLAB is a high-precision mosaic generator designed for creative professionals. It transforms digital imagery into geometric, vector-ready brick layouts, perfect for large-format printing, plotting, and architectural visualization.

## FEATURES

### 🧱 Adaptive Grid Engine

BRICKLAB's core engine automatically quantizes images into a variable-density grid. It calculates local color averages to construct a clean, brick-based reconstruction of your source material, preserving essential details while enforcing a rigid geometric aesthetic.

### 🎛️ Precision Control

- **Dynamic Density**: Fine-tune the grid resolution in real-time.
- **Non-Destructive Workflow**: Full Undo/Redo support (`Cmd+Z`, `Shift+Cmd+Z`) for all density adjustments.
- **Auto-Reset**: Instantly revert to default scaling with a single click.

### 🚀 Professional Export Pipeline

BRICKLAB is built for production:

- **High-Res PNG**: Automatic upscaling ensures your outputs are print-ready (minimum 5000px height), regardless of input size.
- **Vector SVG**: Exports resolution-independent SVG paths, optimized for vinyl cutters, pen plotters (Axidraw), and vector software (Illustrator/Figma).
- **Smart Filenaming**: Files are automatically tagged with a clean timestamp (`BRICKLAB YYYY-MM-DD HH.mm.ss`) for easy asset management.

### 📂 Broad Format Support

Drag and drop any major format: `JPG`, `PNG`, `GIF`, `WEBP`, `TIFF`, and `HEIC` (Apple ecosystem support included).

### ⚡ Brutalist Interface

A stripped-back, distraction-free environment aimed purely at creation. High-contrast visibility, fixed tools, and a focus on the canvas.
